## Experiment 1: Tier B smoke A/B, horizon=1 (2026-07-21)

Setup: Tier B (94M total / 56M active, 8 experts top-2), FineWeb-edu stream,
6000 steps x 8 x 512 = ~25M tokens, bf16 on Radeon 8060S (TheRock rocm7.13),
~19.7k tok/s. Control = baseline backbone (lambda_pred=0) + posthoc-trained
predictor on frozen weights (2000 steps, plateaued by step 500).

| Run | hit@k, 1 layer ahead | val LM loss |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline + posthoc predictor (SOTA control) | 0.849 | 5.942 |
| Joint predictability training (lambda_pred=0.1) | **0.892** | 5.937 |

- Joint training buys **+4.3 pts** of one-layer-ahead expert hit rate at
  **zero LM-quality cost** (5.937 vs 5.942, within noise).
- Direction supports the proposal; scale is small and horizon=1 is the
  easiest case (pre-attention activations are already highly informative).

Next: horizons {1,2,4} — disk latency needs 2+ layers of lead, and prior work
shows frozen-model predictability drops sharply with horizon; the joint
advantage should grow there. Also lambda_pred ablation.

Artifacts: ckpt_tierB_{base,joint,posthoc}.pt; run_tierB_{base,joint,posthoc}.log
